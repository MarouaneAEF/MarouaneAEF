👋 Hey there!
🎓 I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong scientific background. I design intelligent solutions at the crossroads of R&D and real-world deployment. Passionate about probabilistic models, deep learning, and optimization, I build robust architectures for anomaly detection, generative modeling, and unsupervised learning.

🎯 Current focus: mastering MLOps tools to scale ML systems efficiently.

💼 What I do
🔍 Probabilistic Modeling & Anomaly Detection

GMM-VAE: Variational Autoencoder with GMM clustering for unsupervised anomaly detection
BiGAN-based Anomaly Detector: Detection using Bidirectional GANs
Expectation-Maximization: Custom implementation of the EM algorithm
🧠 Applied Research

Neural-E-M: Hybrid algorithm combining neural networks and Expectation-Maximization
L1BSR: Image reconstruction using L1 regularization
📈 MLOps / Production-Grade ML (in progress)

Model tracking with MLflow
Deployment on AWS using SageMaker
Unit testing, CI/CD, and containerization
🌐 My ecosystem
🧠 PhD in Engineering, 5+ years of experience in mathematical modeling and data science
🚀 Transitioning into roles as ML Engineer / MLOps / Applied AI R&D
🤝 Open to full-time and freelance opportunities
